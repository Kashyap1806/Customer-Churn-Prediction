# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using Logistic Regression. But more importantly — it solves two real-world business problems:

1. 🔁 **Reducing customer acquisition costs** by identifying at-risk users for proactive retention.
2. 📈 **Boosting marketing ROI** by targeting upsell offers to loyal, low-risk customers.

## 🔍 Business Problem

Customer churn directly impacts revenue and long-term growth. Most companies spend 5–7x more acquiring a new customer than retaining an existing one.

This project simulates how a Data Scientist at a telecom company can:
- Predict which customers are likely to churn
- Help marketing and support teams act on those insights
- Improve operational efficiency and reduce costs

## 💼 Business Solutions Delivered

### ✅ 1. Reduce Acquisition Cost
- **193 customers** were correctly identified as likely churners
- These can be targeted with **retention offers** before they leave
- Helps reduce churn-driven acquisition costs

### ✅ 2. Smarter Upsell Campaigns
- **914 customers** were identified as **stable**
- These are great targets for **upsell or cross-sell offers**
- Increases campaign ROI by avoiding churn-prone users
